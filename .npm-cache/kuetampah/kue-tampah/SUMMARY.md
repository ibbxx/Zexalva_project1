# Kue Tampah Refactor Summary

## What Was Fixed
- Restored successful `pnpm dev`/`pnpm build` workflows for both frontend (Next.js 14) and backend (Express + Prisma) without runtime crashes or TypeScript errors.
- Repaired broken module resolution by moving server-side helpers (`services/`, `utils/`) and Next Intl assets into the frontend workspace and wiring proper `tsconfig` path aliases.
- Added all missing frontend dependencies (Radix UI, React Query, Next Auth, Supabase, Stripe, etc.) plus root dev tooling to stop module-not-found build failures.
- Created a resilient Supabase client shim so pages render gracefully when Supabase environment variables are absent, while still surfacing informative warnings for write operations.
- Normalised Tailwind/PostCSS and Intl configuration locations so Next.js can discover them inside the workspace package.
- Ensured remote image hosts and default env variables are configured to prevent `next/image` and NextAuth runtime errors.

## Key Refactor Decisions
- Introduced a shared `tsconfig.base.json` and tightened frontend `tsconfig` (with `@tsconfig/next`) for consistent compiler settings across packages.
- Relocated configuration files (`i18n.ts`, `navigation.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `next-intl.config.ts`, Tailwind/PostCSS) into `frontend/` to keep each workspace self-contained.
- Added an in-repo Supabase stub that returns empty datasets for read paths and descriptive errors for mutations, avoiding invasive rewrites while keeping SSR stable.
- Cleaned dependency manifests and `.env` defaults, consolidating env access through `env.ts` and adding `NEXTAUTH_URL` to silence NextAuth warnings.

## Remaining TODOs
- Populate real Supabase credentials (or replace Supabase usage with backend APIs) to enable full CRUD flows such as cart mutations and admin management.
- Audit backend Prisma services vs. frontend Supabase logic for eventual consolidation, ensuring both platforms operate on a single source of truth.
- Add automated tests (unit/E2E) once data providers are finalised to guard against regressions in cart, order, and voucher flows.
